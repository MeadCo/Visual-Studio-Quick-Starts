# Visual-Studio-Quick-Starts
This repo contains a Visual Studio 2013 solution with the sample web application projects created in the quick start tutorials.
The samples are simple but save you having to type if you just want a quick look at the code required to control printing within Internet Explorer.
# Using the sample
The easiest way to use these sammples is to download the zip file containing the current version using the "Download ZIP" button. Then, unpack the archive and open the sample solution in Visual Studio (2013 or later).
